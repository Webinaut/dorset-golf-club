          <p>
            The Royal Park Ladies Golf Club was formed in March 1972 by Mavis
            Boland and Olive Barass, together with a group of friends. Prior to
            this, women had played as Associate members of The Royal Park Golf
            Club since 1906.
          </p>
          <p>
            The contribution made by Mavis Boland to the Club continues to be
            acknowledged by the naming of the trophy for the annual Club
            Champion in her honour.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the 1970s and 1980s, RPLGC had successful Pennant teams,
            winning a number of Premierships in both sections E and B.
            Approximately 40 years after the last pennant team competed, the
            2023 and 2024 teams won their divisions to the delight of members.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the years the women have been involved in many fundraising and
            social events for the benefit of the club and charities.
